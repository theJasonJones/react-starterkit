# React Starterkit

The point of this repo is so I can have a headstart for when I begin up new projects. Feel free to edit as needed.

## Development
1. `yarn install` - Might have to include `--ignore-engines` 

2.  `yarn start` - to get the webpack server up and running

3. `yarn lint` - Check the code against 

## Notable Packages

1.  **[Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)** - a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript.

2.  **[Eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)** - a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. _Note_ I use the [Airbnb config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) with some minor changes

3.  **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** - a bundler. Version 4. Utilizes `webpack-cli` and `webpack-dev-server`.

4.  **[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)** - uses git hooks to prevent bad code from being committed.

5.  **[Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)** - modern CSS linter and fixer that helps you avoid errors and enforce consistent conventions in your stylesheets.

6.  **[Lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)** - a linter that runs on staged files.

7.  **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)** - is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.

8.  **[Prettier-eslint](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint)** - uses prettier to auto-format/fix much of your code according to your ESLint config.

9.  **[react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)** - Tweak React components in real time.

## TODO

1. ~~ Add `styled-components`. ~~
2.  Add `axios`.
3.  Add `next.js`?.
4.  Add `react-router`
